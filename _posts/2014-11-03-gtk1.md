GTK+是用来创造图形界面的库，它可以运行在许多类UNIX系统，Windows和OS X。GTK+按照GNU LGPL许可证发布，这个许可证对程序来说相对宽松。GTK+有一个基于C的面向对象的灵活架构，它有对于许多其他语言的版本 ，包括C++，Objective-C， Guile/Scheme, Perl, Python, TOM, Ada95, Free Pascal和Eiffel。
GTK+依赖于以下库：

*    GLib
A general-purpose utility library, not specific to graphical user interfaces. GLib provides many useful data types, macros, type conversions, string utilities, file utilities, a main loop abstraction, and so on. 
*    GObject
A library that provides a type system, a collection of fundamental types including an object type, a signal system. 
*    GIO
A modern, easy-to-use VFS API including abstractions for files, drives, volumes, stream IO, as well as network programming and DBus communication.
*    cairo
Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices. 
*    Pango
Pango is a library for internationalized text handling. It centers around the PangoLayout object, representing a paragraph of text. Pango provides the engine for GtkTextView, GtkLabel, GtkEntry, and other widgets that display text. 
*    ATK
ATK is the Accessibility Toolkit. It provides a set of generic interfaces allowing accessibility technologies to interact with a graphical user interface. For example, a screen reader uses ATK to discover the text in an interface and read it to blind users. GTK+ widgets have built-in support for accessibility using the ATK framework. 
*    GdkPixbuf
This is a small library which allows you to create GdkPixbuf ("pixel buffer") objects from image data or image files. Use a GdkPixbuf in combination with GtkImage to display images. 
*    GDK
GDK is the abstraction layer that allows GTK+ to support multiple windowing systems. GDK provides window system facilities on X11, Windows, and OS X. 
*    GTK+
The GTK+ library itself contains widgets, that is, GUI components such as GtkButton or GtkTextView. 

##第一节 开始使用GTK+

这一节包括一些帮助你开始学习GTK+编程的教程。该节假设你已经安装了GTK+，依赖库和C编译器(**安装方法可参考附录1**)。如果你需要编译GTK+本身，查看手册中编译GTK+的部分。


```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    for(int i=2;i<2;i++)
	/* hello world demo
	hihihi
	*/
    {
        printf("hi");
    }
    return 0;
    //hihihi
}
```
